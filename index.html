            <p>Things to Know Before Becoming a Fashion Designer
                Considering a career in fashion? Wondering how to become a fashion designer? Before applying to design schools, make sure you have done your research. Here are three things to know before becoming a fashion designer.
                
                As a creative art, fashion thrives on artistic ability. Passion and drive help keep designers going in this demanding career. As with other artistic pursuits, it can take time for designers to see their efforts pay off. Confidence and drive carry designers to their professional goals.
                Do fashion designers need strong drawing skills? Not necessarily. Today, many designers work with software programs to create designs. Others pin fabric by hand to craft the perfect drape. While drawing skills help, you do not need to draw like da Vinci to be a fashion designer.
                Networking matters in fashion. Even before applying to fashion design programs, start investing in an industry network. That means attending events, staying current with fashion news, and connecting with designers, manufacturers, and suppliers. Continue to meet industry professionals during school to enter the workforce backed by a strong network.</p>
